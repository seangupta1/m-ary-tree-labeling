# m-ary-tree-labeling
**Group Project**

## Overview
This project addresses the problem of assigning integer labels to the vertices of an **m-ary tree** while maintaining unique edge weights such that:

1. Each edge weight equals the sum of the labels of its two endpoints.  
2. All edge weights are unique.  
3. The maximum vertex label is `ceil(n/2)`  
   where \( n \) is the number of vertices.  
4. Labels follow a chosen **k-labeling strategy**.

The goal is to design, implement, and evaluate an algorithm that satisfies these constraints.
